# Movie-Cue-Backend
Movie-cue-backend is the backend portion of a movie listing and review site. It uses rails and is used in conjunction with Movie-Cue-Frontend, which handles the frontend portion of the app. Users can look up, add, edit, and delete movies. They can also read, write, and delete reviews. It currently does not have sign-up or sign-in features, but I plan on adding those in the future.
